### Contributing

Inside the folder `src/lib` is the actual library that you can ~~copy and paste~~ use in your own apps.
`src/app` contains the code for the demonstration and example.
When contributing, make sure to edit the `lib` folder and make any necessary changes to the `app` folder if the API was modified.
